	<p class="about">I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, studying Marketing in the Wisconsin School of Business. I am passionate about both environmental and social responsibility. Businesses can't continue to be run the way they have been in the past. I believe in the triple bottom line - that people and the planet are just as important as profits. In the future, I'd be very interested to work as a Project Manager in a firm with its own marketing team, or as an Account Director in an Advertising Agency. After I graduate with my Bachelor's degree, I'd like to spend a few years living on the West Coast, perhaps in Seattle or the Bay Area. After I've experienced life outside of the Midwest, I want to return to the Twin Cities area to be near my family.</p>
